# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-Level Testing Plan

## Test Types
For the purpose of this report, only the exploratory test plan will be outlined in this section. In practice, the team will be using 3 types of testing: exploratory, manual scripted, and regression.

## Exploratory Testing Scope

For exploratory testing, the requirements from the table below will be tested. These high level requirements are defined in Appendix B, of the assignment 1 readme file.

| High level requirements                                           | User    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Make cash withdrawal from any account, in multiples of 20        | Customer|
| Deposit to any account                                            | Customer|
| Transfer money between accounts linked to card                   | Customer|
| Abort transaction in process by pressing cancel instead of responding | Customer|
| Communicate transactions to bank and get bank verification        | ATM     |
| For deposits, send confirmation to bank that envelope has been deposited | ATM     |
| If pin is invalid after 3 attempts, card is retained by machine and account is locked | ATM     |
| Display reasons for any failed transactions, prompt for another transaction | ATM     |
| Provide receipt for successful transactions                       | ATM     |
| Key-operated switch that allows operator to start and stop machine| ATM     |
| When turned on prompts for total cash in machine                  | ATM     |
| Logs transactions internally starting when ATM is started up. Never contains pin number. | ATM     |

Each of these requirements will be tested from the inital state of the ATM being turned on and idle. During the process of testing each requirement, any defects  that are found will be reported using Azure DevOps bug reporting feature. Each of the reported bugs will include the following details:
 - Testing Type
 - Function
 - Software Version
 - Severity of bug
 - Initial system state
 - Steps to reproduce defect
 - Expected outcome and actual outcome

## Exploratory Testing Logistics

### Initial Program Exploration
- To familiarize ourselves with the program as a whole, each student individually followed steps 1-12 in the 'Familiarization with the ATM System' subsection of the 'Instructions' section.

### Pair Programming
- For each of the high level functions listed above, one student attempted to complete the high level function as described, and the other student made notes of any bugs that were encountered, paying careful attention to details like display, log, and state information.

    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
